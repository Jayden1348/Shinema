Shinema supports:

- User login and account management
- Movie listing, searching, and sorting by genre
- Seat and bar reservations
- Food and drink management (inventory, sales)
- Cinema information editing (address, opening hours, contact)
- Admin features for adding/editing/deleting movies, showings, and catering items
- Sales and turnover reporting
  
Data is stored in JSON files (movies, reservations, food, seats) in the DataSources folder, and business logic is separated into the Logic folder. The application uses a menu-driven interface for navigation, with different options for regular users and admins.
